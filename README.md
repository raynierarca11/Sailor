 And when you get a taste, can you tell me what'dds my flavor?
I don't believe in God, but I believe that you're my savior.
My mom says that she's worri ed, but I'm covered in this favor
And when we're getting. dirty, I forget all that is wrong
I sleep so I can see you 'cause I hate to wait so long
I sleep so I can see you and I hate to wait so long
She took my fingers to her mouth
The kind of thing that makes you proud
That nothing else had ever.
Worked out, worked out
And lately, I've tried other things
But nothing can capture the sting
Of the venom she's gonna spit out right now
Oh, won't you kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor?
When you get a taste, can you tell me what's my flavor?
I don't believe in God, but I believe that you're my savior
I know that you've been worried, but you're dripping in my favor
And when we're getting dirty, I forget all that is wrong
I sleep so I can see you 'cause I hate to wait so long
I sleep so that I can see you and I hate to wait so long
And we can run away to the walls inside your house
I can be the cat, baby, you can be the mouse
And we can laugh off things that we know nothing about
We can go forever until you wanna sit it out.
